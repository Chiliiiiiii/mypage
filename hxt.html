    <h3>PI: The Open Research Topic of the National Key Laboratory of Information Security: Research on the Single-Cycle T-Function in Cryptography.</h3>
    <p><strong>Research on Single-Cycle T-function in Cryptography.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Research Areas:</strong> cyberspace security; information security; cryptography;symmetric encryption algorithm;hash function</p>
    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong>The core objective of the project is to conduct in -depth analysis and exploration of the application and performance of single-circle T-functions in cryptography. The T-function (Transformation Function) is a crucial component in cryptographic algorithms, particularly in symmetric encryption algorithms (such as AES, DES) and hash functions.A single-circle T-function refers to a specific type of transformation in cryptography that has significant mathematical properties and security advantages, effectively enhancing the cryptographic algorithm's resistance to attacks, especially in defending against linear and differential attacks. This project will involve mathematical modeling and experimental analysis to study the structural characteristics, computational efficiency, and security performance of single-circle T-functions in practical cryptographic systems.</p>
